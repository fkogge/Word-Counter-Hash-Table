# Word-Counting-Hash-Table
## About this Project
Data structures programming project from Seattle University's Computer Science Fundamentals program.

This is a C++ program which implements a hash table, recording a unique set of words from a text file. To resolve collisions or different words hashing to the same index of the hash table, the separate chaining technique is used. The hash table (array) is automatically resized based on the current load factor of the hash table in order to maximize efficiency.
